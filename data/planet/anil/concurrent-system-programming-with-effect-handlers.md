<p>Paper on concurrent systems programming with effect handlers at TFP 2017, expanding on our ML Workshop work. This paper with Stephen Dolan, Spiros Eliopoulos, Daniel Hillerstrom, KC Sivaramakrishnan and Leo White demonstrated that effect handlers in Multicore OCaml could elegantly express difficult concurrent systems programs without performance compromises. We showed that highly concurrent web servers built with effect handlers performed on par with heavily optimized monadic concurrency libraries, while maintaining the simplicity of direct-style code - a significant practical achievement.</p>
